	<p>walking through the technological slum of Ninsei, blinded by the electric dance of lights. it seems like the night never leaves, but agent Vance hasn’t slept in days. he tries to pop another dex fearing he might flatline. he looks to the side and see’s an eerie alley with a door that looks both uninviting and alluring. he thinks to himself, “I wonder what kind of music they play in the dark corners of the district?”</p>
